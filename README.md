# Bulldozer Price Prediction

## 1. Problem Definition
The goal of this project is to predict the sale price of a particular piece of heavy equipment at auction based on its usage, equipment type, and configuration. The dataset is sourced from auction result postings and includes detailed information about equipment usage and configurations.

## 2. Data
The dataset is split into three parts:
- **Train.csv**: The training set, which contains data up to the end of 2011.
- **Valid.csv**: The validation set, containing data from January 1, 2012, to April 30, 2012. This set is used throughout most of the competition to test predictions and update the public leaderboard.
- **Test.csv**: The test set, containing data from May 1, 2012, to November 2012. This data is released in the final week of the competition, and predictions on this set determine the final ranking.

## 3. Evaluation
The competition uses **RMSLE** (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error) as the evaluation metric, which measures the error between the actual and predicted auction prices. Lower RMSLE values indicate better model performance.

## 4. Model Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Handling missing values
    - Encoding categorical data
    - Feature scaling
2. **Model Selection**:
    - We will try different regression models like RandomForest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting to predict the sale prices.
3. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Use cross-validation on the training set to assess the performance of different models.
    - Compare model results based on RMSLE score.

## 5. Technologies Used
- **Python**: For building the predictive models
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization
- **Scikit-Learn**: For model building and evaluation
- **XGBoost**: For advanced tree-based modeling

## 6. Setup Instructions
